<div class="alert alert-warning">
Permissions have changed. You may need to update your configuration.
</div>

Wildcard permissions have been removed in favor of the new style permission nodes introduced with SuperPerms. This means for example where `hearthstone.teleport.*` would give you access to everything underneath that node, you now need to just grant hearthstone.teleport. 

If you just want someone to be able to teleport to their own home you would grant hearthstone.teleport.own. It is not necessary to also grant hearthstone.teleport.

## Improvements

* Permission changes (see above)
* Tab completion of all commands.
