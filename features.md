<p class="lead">jChat allows administrators to assign different chat prefixes and suffixes to players who join your server.</p>

## Chat titles

jChat allows you to assign a chat title to players who join your server. A title is a combination of a prefix and a suffix. Commonly these prefixes are colour codes although there is nothing to stop you using anything else. Here are some common examples:

* Give players that belong to different ranks different colour names.
* Give special prefixes to players with certain roles (eg. Mayor) 

## Coloured server messages

jChat will automatically format server messages to reflect a players display name. No other additionally formatting is done. The messages currently supported are:

* join messages
* quit messages
* death messages

## Scoreboard support

New in version 2.0.0 is the ability to reflect a player's prefixes and suffixes on the player list (tab). This also allows for the same title to be reflected above a player's head in the game.
