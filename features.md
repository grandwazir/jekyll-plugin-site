<p class="lead">Create and manage multiple worlds on your server quickly and easily. You can then customise the worlds and modify the settings of each individually.</p>

## Create multiple worlds

You can use DimensionDoor to create multiple worlds for your Minecraft players. In vanilla Minecraft you can have only three worlds; the main world, the nether world and the end.

With DimensionDoor you can have as many as you like, within the resources available to you to host the server, and any type you like. Below are some of the ways you could use the plugin:

* Create a mining world which you reset periodically.
* Create a nether world for a secret adventure dungeon.
* Use a custom world generator to create a floating island paradise. 

### Custom world support

You may have heard of custom world generators. These are additional plugins that change the way a world is generated. They range from simple flat map generators to more complex plugins which you can configure and specify.

DimensionDoor fully supports custom world generation. Find the generator you want and read the instructions in 'Getting started' to get your world created.

## World specific settings

DimensionDoor also allows you to configure your worlds individually. This means you can have PvP enabled for one world but not another. You could also have different difficulties; hard for the nether and maybe normal for your main world.

You can currently configure the following things for each world:

* The difficulty
* If the world is enabled (loaded into memory)
* The default game mode for players
* If monsters should spawn
* If animals should spawn
* If PvP is allowed
* If the world has a custom texture pack
* If chat is isolated (more on this later)
* If players should respawn in the same world they died in.

### Isolated chat

This allows players who are in one world to only be able to talk to players in the same world. This is very useful for adventure worlds. It is also useful for bigger servers with lots of worlds and many players; where chat can become quite difficult to follow.
