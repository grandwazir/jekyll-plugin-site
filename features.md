<p class="lead">TimedRestore allows administrators to configure the automatic restoration of <a href="http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/worldguard/">WorldGuard</a> regions to a previous <a href="http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/worldedit/">WorldEdit</a> snapshotâ€Ž.</p>

<div class="alert alert-block">
  This plugin requires that you have WorldEdit and WorldGuard installed to be able to use it.
</div>

## Scheduling

You can set a very flexible schedule for when you want a region to be restored. Here are a few of the schedules that are possible with TimedRestore:

* The last day in a month
* Every 2 weeks on a Monday
* Every day
* Every 4 hours.

For examples on how to schedule regions to be restored, view the getting started page for more details. 

## Restoring

Using the plugin you can restore any WorldGuard region back to a particular point in time using WorldEdit snapshots. Here are some examples of how the plugin could be used on your server:

* Restore mines back to their original state every 2 months.
* Refresh building plots in a guest area every week.
* Restore an adventure dungeon on the hour (including loot and prizes).
