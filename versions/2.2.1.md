<div class="alert alert-block">
  The method of localising the plugin has changed. Editing the .properties file in the .jar is now the only supported way. Additionally some keys have changed.
</div>

## New features

* Added dynamic caching of bans for faster logins.
* Added `banhammer.permanent` to permit players to ban permanently.

## Improvements

* Ban immune players can now be banned if the player has the `banhammer.ban` permission instead of `banhammer`.
* Reduced the number of keys required to be localised. Should make things easier for translaters.
* Debugging information is more helpful.

## Bug fixes

* Fixed issue where large databases could cause disconnects when using tab completion.
* Fixed various localisation issues.
