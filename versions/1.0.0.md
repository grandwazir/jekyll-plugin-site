Initial release of TimedRestore!

TimedRestore is a plugin for the Minecraft wrapper [Bukkit](http://bukkit.org/) that allows adminstrators to configure the automatic restoration of [WorldGuard](dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/worldguard) regions to a previous [WorldEdit](dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/worldedit/â€Ž
) snapshot. This is useful to reset guest or other public areas back to a known good state.
