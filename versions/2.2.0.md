  New commands have been added. You may need to update your configuration. 
</div>

## New features

* Added audit command. Enables you to see how many bans a person has made.
* Added undo command. Enables you to undo a ban you have made by accident.

## Improvements

* Improved formatting of the ban kick message.
* Tab completion is now more aware (will not provide names of players who are not banned when using /bh check for example).
* Added ban reason and ban time as an option for localisation in kick messages.
* Purge command works like pardon now (own and other permission nodes).

## Bug fixes

* Fixed issue where players with set limits were able to ban permanently.
* Fixed an issue where the banhammer.notify permission was not being registered correctly.
